Hi, I'm Sten. I'm an astronomer, but you won't find much astronomy code here. In my "free" time I like to engage in a variety of tech projects, initially inspired by launching some high-altitude balloons while a postdoc at the University of Utah. Enjoy these git repositories with often questionably-written code, but code that can be used to make some cool payloads for rockets and balloons! You also might find some various other things, like how to make strava maps, or how to master the stock market.
