- Hi, I'm Sten. I'm an astronomer, but you won't find much astronomy code here.
- In my "free" time I like to engage in a variety of tech projects, initially inspired by 
- launching some high-altitude balloons while a postdoc at the University of Utah.
- Enjoy these git repositories with often questionably-written code, but code that can 
- be used to make some cool payloads!
